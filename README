# AURS

A D program for downloading AUR dependencies for Arch Linux.

This is not intended to be a replacment for pacman, just something to live
alongside it.

Look up a name in AUR, returning results with some additional information.

    aurs info <pkgname>

Get package data, including Name, Version, and Maintainer, in a similar format
to `pacman -Si` or `pacman -Qi`.

    aurs dlall <pkgname>

Get the latest package snapshot for <pkgname> as well as all of its
dependencies from AUR, and output a shell script to build them in reverse order
of discovery.

    aurs download <pkgname>
